Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) Accounting for Overlapping Subjects: Designed and executed large-scale simulation studies using high-performance parallel computing to evaluate meta-analysis methods under overlapping subject scenarios in GWAS. Simulated over 32 unique configurations, generating 1 million datasets per setting to assess the performance of fixed-effect models with robust variance estimation and the Cauchy combination test in controlling type I error and improving power. Generated genotype and phenotype data under logistic models using varying overlap proportions and sample sizes, modeling realistic GWAS conditions. Results demonstrated that robust meta-analysis techniques outperformed naïve approaches in controlling inflated error rates due to sample overlap. Effectively communicated findings through well-organized visualizations, tables, and a written report to facilitate interpretation and future methodological development. (Mar 2024 – May 2024)
