Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies Accounting for Overlapping Subjects: Developed simulated GWAS data under various configurations using logistic regression using parallel computation. Investigated the performance of fixed effect models with robust variance estimation and the Cauchy combination test for accounting dependency structures. Calculated Type-I error rates under nulls, power under alternatives of genetic effects and correlation under both hypotheses. Drew conclusions on methodology effectiveness and discussed methods for reducing simulation time.
